6. Maximal Triangle Sum:
	Desc:
		Given a integer number pyramid,  starting at the top of the triangle and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, find the maximum sum of the digits.

	input:
		N [ number of lines ]
		elemnts of the pyramid [ x N ]

	constraints:
		N < 200

	output:
		M [ integer ]
	
	sample io:
		.	4
			3
			7 4
			2 4 6
			8 5 9 3
		. 23

	explaination:
		In the above triangle, the route with the maximum sum is 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23
