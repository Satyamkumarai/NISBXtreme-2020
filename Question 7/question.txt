9. Intersections:
	Desc:
		Given N (x,y) coordinate tuple pairs, find the number of distinct true intersections between any two of the lines formed.
		An intersection is a true intersection if 
			1. The point of intersection is not one of the two endpoints given , and 
			2. The point of intersection is an interior point on both the lines.

	input:
		N [ integer : number of lines ]
		x1 y1 x2 y2 [ x N : space seperated integers ]

	constraints:
		N < 5000
		0 < x < 500
		0 < y < 500
	
	output:
		P [ integer ]
